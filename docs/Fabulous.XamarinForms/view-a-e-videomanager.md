Using VideoManager
------
##### (topic last updated: pending
<br /> 

The MediaManager plugin allow to play audio and video with Xamarin. Using this VideoManager, you can create a dedicated view to render a video in your fabulous application.

MediaManager has been created by Martijn van Dijk and its original project can be found on [its github repository](https://github.com/martijn00/XamarinMediaManager).

The nuget [`Fabulous.XamarinForms.VideoManager`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Fabulous.VideoManager) implements a view component for the type [VideoView](https://github.com/martijn00/XamarinMediaManager).

To use `Fabulous.XamarinForms.VideoView`, you must

1. Add a reference to `Plugin.MediaManager` and `Plugin.MediaManager.Forms` across your whole solution.  This will add appropriate references to your platform-specific Android and iOS projects too.
2. Next add a reference to `Fabulous.XamarinForms.VideoManager` across your whole solution.

After these steps you can use VideoView in your view function. Here is a simple example of using VideoView to
display a video player of Big Buck Bunny:

```fsharp
open Fabulous.XamarinForms

View.VideoView(
  source = "https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4",
  showControls = false,
  heightRequest = 500.,
  widthRequest = 200.)
```
